    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made of layered wide, flat pasta sheets with sauces (typically a meat-based ragù or a béchamel sauce) and various cheeses, such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong>For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong>I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong>To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach:</strong>Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Important: Let the Lasagna Rest</h4>
    <p>Once removed from the oven, let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes (up to 45 minutes is fine, it will retain the heat well). This will allow it to thicken up a bit and help it keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.</p>
